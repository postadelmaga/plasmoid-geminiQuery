# Gemini Query

**Gemini Query** is a lightweight KDE Plasma 6 widget that brings the intelligence of Google Gemini directly to your desktop. Designed for daily insights, motivational quotes, or quick technical facts, it performs recurring queries and keeps the results beautifully rendered on your panel or desktop.

## ✨ Features

- **Customizable Experience**: 
    - Set a custom title for the widget (e.g. "Quote of the Day").

- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern interface that fits perfectly with the Breeze theme.

## 💾 Smart Caching System

Gemini Query features an efficient local caching system designed to save your API quota and ensure the widget feels instant:
- **Daily Persistance**: Your response is saved locally and survives system restarts.
- **Automatic Invalidation**: The cache is automatically cleared and a fresh query is triggered whenever you change your question or the selected model in the settings.
- **Manual Control**: Easily clear the cache at any time from the configuration window.
